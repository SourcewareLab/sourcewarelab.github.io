2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the forked repository to your local development environment.<br><br>
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/community-website.git`

3. **Create a New Branch Locally:** Create a branch for your feature or fix. Name your branch in a way that describes the purpose of your changes. For example:
- `feature/feature-name`

4. **Make Your Changes:**
   - Add your code, features, or bug fixes.
