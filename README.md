# 🚀 How to Contribute

We love contributions from everyone! Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, your help is always appreciated. Here's how you can contribute:

Follow the steps below to contribute effectively:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the forked repository to your local development environment.<br><br>
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/community-website.git`

3. **Create a New Branch Locally:** Create a branch for your feature or fix. Name your branch in a way that describes the purpose of your changes. For example:
- `feature/feature-name`
- `bugfix/bug-description`
- `docs/clarify-setup-instructions`

4. **Make Your Changes:**
   - Add your code, features, or bug fixes.

5. **Commit Guidelines:** When committing changes to your branch, please follow this naming scheme to keep commit history clean and readable:

Commit message format: `<type>:<short-description>`

Types:

    feat: A new feature or functionality added to the project.
    fix: A bug fix.
    docs: Documentation changes.
    style: Code style changes (e.g., formatting, missing semicolons).
    refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature, but improve the structure.
    test: Adding or modifying tests.
    chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools.

Example Commit Messages:

    feat: add user authentication to the website
    fix: resolve issue with missing image on homepage
